This is a path-finding visualizer, where I have created a visual representation of many graph algorithms which are used in real world to implement path-finding applications. 

The algorithms implemented in this visualiser are:
1. BFS (unweighted)
2. DFS (unweighted)
4. Dijkstra (weighted)
4. A* (weighted)
5. greedy BFS (weighted)
6. swarm algorithm (weighted)
7. convergent swarm algorithm (weighted)
8. Bi-directional swarm algorithm (weighted)

The graph used in this tool is a 2-D maze with having functionality to add extra walls/obstacles.
Some of the above-mentioned algorithms are weighted graphs. So in case of weighted graph algorithms, it's been considered that turning changing the direction of movement will be costly.
